## <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>

  My name is Amir, I am 15 years old and I'm a sophomore. This is my second year of taking AP Computer Science. I'm a bit nervous to take this class especially given the stories of its difficulty from my upper-classmen. However, I won't let their struggles disuade me from trying my best to get an A in this class and a 5 on the AP exam. Honestly, even though I know it will only get more challenging and confusing from here, I am excited.

##  <strong><u>Summer Activities</u></strong>

 This summer was a lot more fun than I anticipated. Over the past few years, due to obligations or money issues, it is rare my family and I would get to have big, vacation-filled summers. This is no fault of my mother or anyone else, and I'm not upset by this. I've accepted it as reality and must simply live with it. Besides, summers can be fun without flying to other countries or backpacking in Oregon. This summer I expected another, generally mundane, summer. However, I was delighfully surprised when almost every other week we were doing fun activities. We went to Venice Beach and went on a lovely bike ride along the beach. I ended up getting lost on the way back and had to walk the strip back to our start point. We also went to Hurricane Harbor 3 times, each time was more fun than the last. Although I don't find water parks the most enjoyable, I ended each day thouroughly satisfied with my experience. Besides that we did other fun activities like taking long drrives, going to the pool with friends, baking with my family, going thrifting, etc.

## <u><strong>Goals For This School Year</u></strong>
  This school year my academic goal is to end both semesters with straight A's <u>without</u> any assistance via AP test scores or GPA boosters. Honestly, from what I understand about highschool and my classes specifically, I think I can achieve it.
