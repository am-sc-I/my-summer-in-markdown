## <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>

  My name is Amir, I am 15 years old and I'm a sophomore. This is my second year of taking AP Computer Science. I'm a bit nervous to take this class especially given the stories of its difficulty from my upper-classmen. However, I won't let their struggles disuade me from trying my best to get an A in this class and a 5 on the AP exam. Honestly, even though I know it will only get more challenging and confusing from here, I am excited.

##  <strong><u>Summer Activities</u></strong>

 This summer was a lot more fun than I anticipated. Over the past few years, due to obligations or money issues, it is rare my family and I would get to have big, vacation-filled summers. This is no fault of my mother or anyone else, and I'm not upset by this. I've accepted it as reality and must simply live with it. Besides, summers can be fun without flying to other countries or backpacking in Oregon. This summer I expected another, generally mundane, summer. However, I was delighfully surprised when almost every other week we were doing fun activities. We went to Venice Beach and went on a lovely bike ride along the beach. I ended up getting lost on the way back and had to walk the strip back to our start point. We also went to Hurricane Harbor 3 times, each time was more fun than the last. Although I don't find water parks the most enjoyable, I ended each day thouroughly satisfied with my experience. Besides that we did other fun activities like taking long drrives, going to the pool with friends, baking with my family, going thrifting, etc.

## <u><strong>Goals For This School Year</u></strong>
  This school year my academic goal is to end both semesters with straight A's <u>without</u> any assistance via AP test scores or GPA boosters. Honestly, from what I understand about highschool and my classes specifically, I think I can achieve it. I also want to make strides in improving my health, mental and physical. Although last year I was by no means physically unhealthy, I left any ailments I had on the backburner to address later as well as allowing my mental health to spiral beyond control. Lastly, by the end of this year I will have achieved most if not all of my longer term volleyball goals. This I consider less of a goal and more of a declaration.

  ## <u><strong>Favorite Summer Food</u></strong>
  Over the summer my family and I made a lot of different, experimental dishes with the  extra time we had to ourselves. Pancakes, brownies, curry, pasta, pretty much anything baked or was trending, we made it. The pastas were definitely a highlight, even when reheated multiple days in a row they tasted as good as the day they were made. However my <strong>favorite</strong> food of the summer has to be the cucumber salads I made with soy sauce, chili oil, and other ingredients. They were completely and utterly unparalled. I expected nothing of it when I first made it except maybe a tinge of disappointment (given the fact I oly made it too satisfy my Poke bowl cravings) but I was deligfully surprised when I tried them and fell in love. The only bit of criticism I can give it is the sheer amount of sodium in the dish, but I suppose that's to be expected. Other than that I will absolutely be adding this cucumber salad and all of its variations to my weekly rotation.

  ## <u><strong>Sports/Physical Activities</u></strong>
  Other than the end of my club volleyball season in early June, most of my summer's physical activity was done at home or in the gym. A lot of people said they noticed a major amount of muscular growth with me compared to last year, but I am blind to it. Regardless, I believe I was efficient with my exercise this summer. After my club season ended, I realized I became very lazy with my personal regimine and decided to dedicate an uninterrupted month to both getting back into the mindset of at-home training as well as the consistency. I also occassionally went to open gyms to try and keep my volleyball skills in tact. I've improved a lot since I ended my club season which is good, my goals finally feal achievable with my current body and my skill level/skill growth rate.
